                Hi my name is Masai. I'm currently taking a full stack developer course in hopes to be one sometime
                soon.
                I love sports. Primarily basketball and football. I love the Jets and the Knicks.
                I was born in Brooklyn, NY and moved to Piscataway, NJ in middleschool.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div id="text">I'm born of haitian descent. I have 2 sisters and a brother. I'm the oldest of them all.
                    I've always had a knack for tech and
                    have always researched and educated myself on many different things. I've built multiple PCs and
                    always troubleshoot my own problems
                    with internet help of course.</div>
                <br>
                <div id="text">I'm more than ready to create something special in a programming career. Becoming a full
                    stack developer is my goal
                    and I will do whatever it takes to make it happen. I'm excited for the future and reaching my
                    potential with the skill gained in
                    this course.
